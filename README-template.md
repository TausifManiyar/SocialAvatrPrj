## My process

I am really bad at explaining things (so forgive me).

I will try my best to explain my process, First thing i did was try to get widths right for all properties, Second thing was to get the buttons right (width, border, color etc). Thats...thats all i have to say.
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop First Workflow

### What I learned

```css
button:hover {
        cursor: pointer;
        color: var(--Off-Black);
        background-color: var(--Green);
}
```

### Continued development

Continuing Forward, I want to focus on making projects more accurate, and get use to using extensions and developer tools.
